Biometric authentication enables a user to log in to the mobile application more securely by using the Fingerprint or FaceID features.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1459).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To apply Fingerprint in the application for subsequent logins, a user should put his finger on the sensor.

And to enable Biometric in the iOS application, a user should tap on the “Use Face ID” button.

After this, the checkbox More -> Settings -> Other -> Biometric authentication becomes True.

A user should enter his password to confirm biometrics:

On subsequent calls of the Login screen form, if the Biometric authentication setting is checked in the application, the appropriate dialog box will be automatically displayed.

The user authentication occurs after putting a finger on the sensor and successful fingerprint recognition.

In case the FaceID feature is available and activated on the user device, it can be used as an additional application login option instead of the Fingerprint.

To deactivate Biometric authentication, uncheck the corresponding setting and then tap the "OK" button on the undermentioned screen:
