* Account – the account used for an order creation;
* Symbol – the symbol available for the trade;
* Side – allows to activate Buy or Sell side;
* Leverage – contains leverage value, if applicable;
* Quantity / Cash – allows specifying the order's volume in either lots (Quantity) or currency (Cash), depending on the account’s permissions:
  * Quantity - an amount of lots in which an order is placed. Tap the value in order to edit it;
  * Cash - when Cash is selected, the order amount is specified in account currency instead of lots. The estimated quantity (Est. Quantity) will be displayed below this field, showing the approximate number of lots, calculated using the following formula:\
    `Qty = CashOrderQty / ( Order price * Lot size * Сross price)`, where:\
    \- CashOrderQty - cash value entered in account currency;\
    \- Order price - order price depending on its type (_Market_ - current market price; _Limit_ and _Stop Limit -_ limit price; _Stop -_ stop price);\
    \- Lot size - symbol Lot size;\
    \- Cross price - conversion rate from the instrument currency to the account currency.\
    Please note that calculated Est. Quantity value is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the Lot Step (e.g., 0.01). For example if Qty = 0.07692, it will be rounded to 0.07.

**Order type:**

Order type defines the type of the order – Market, Limit, Stop, Stop limit, Trailing stop, OCO:

1. Market order guarantees execution at a market price.
2. Limit order is placed with a brokerage to buy or sell a set number of shares at a specified price or better.
3. Stop order is placed to buy or sell a security when its price surpasses a particular point, thus ensuring a greater probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price, limiting the investor's loss or locking in his or her profit. The <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (671).png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon informs a user that additional Limit price is available if the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is active in the Settings;&#x20;
4. Stop limit order will be executed at a specified price (or better) after a given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order becomes a limit order to buy (or sell) at the limit price or better.
5. "Sell" trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price on the trailing offset. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. "Buy" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders.
6. OCO order is a combined order, where the execution of one automatically cancels the other, allowing to define both a profit-taking target and a protection against loss within a single order. OCO is available only when Stop/Stop Limit and Limit orders are allowed for the selected account and symbol. If Cash mode is selected, the order submission is disabled. By default, the Limit price uses the current Ask for Buy or the current Bid for Sell (otherwise the minimum tick), while the Stop price follows standard Stop price logic.

**Validity:**

Validity – allows specifying order validity by selecting among the following time frames: Day, GTC, IOC, GTD, FOK, GTS. This is especially important for active traders:

1. Day order, as the name implies, is valid for the current trading day.
2. GTC (Good till cancelled) orders, on the other hand, will remain alive until they are cancelled.
3. IOC (Immediate or Cancel Order) requires that all or part of the order be executed immediately after it has been brought to the market.
4. FOK (Fill or kill) – requires to execute the entire transaction immediately and completely or not to execute it at all.
5. GTD (Good till date) allows input date until which the order will be cancelled if not executed.

* Overnight execution - if active, the order will be eligible to be placed during overnight market hours. More details can be found [here](../overnight-trading.md).
* SL/TP price – allows to set Stop loss and Take profit prices.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1751).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When the checkbox near SL price is true, and the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is also true (a setting located in Defaults tab of General settings), the additional field 'SL limit price' will appear. It shows Limit price which is set for SL order. This field can also be displayed as 'SL limit offset', depending on the configuration in [Settings](../settings.md).&#x20;

If the _Set SL/TP values in offset_ option is enabled in Settings, the SL/TP values will be displayed as offsets. The format of the offset display depends on the _Show offset in_ setting, which allows choosing between: Ticks, Ticks (fractional ticks for Forex), Points and Percents.

If the _Set SL/TP values in offset_ option is disabled, SL/TP values will be displayed as absolute prices instead.&#x20;

It's also possible to set the validity separately for SL/TP if the _Select SL/TP validity in OE_ parameter is activated in the General settings.

* Trailing SL offset – allows entering the order trailing stop price.

{% hint style="warning" %}
SL price and Trailing SL offset cannot be checked together.
{% endhint %}

* SL trigger/TP trigger - these settings allow a user to select Bid or Ask price for local SL/TP trigger.

6\. GTS (Good till session) order will be cancelled at the end of the trading session if not executed.
