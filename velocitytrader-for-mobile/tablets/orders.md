This feature can be useful for managers or admins, in case there is a need to cancel all currently working orders. The "Cancel all" button is securely hidden in the Account menu to prevent accidental pressing. In order to enable this feature, please contact our support.

Each section consists of the cards list with short information about the orders: for Working orders – symbol name, quantity, open price, order type; for Filled orders – symbol name, order type, Net P/L, quantity.

Here user can modify price, quantity, Validity, Stop loss, Trailing, and Take profit. In addition, order can be executed at a market price.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If Stop limit order is activated, the Stop price field will be disabled in Modify screen. Thus, only Limit price can be modified. The same is true for closing Stop loss limit orders.
{% endhint %}

Bound to - allows linking one order to another so they function as a connected pair (OCO order). User can select an existing order on the same instrument and attach the modified order to it, creating a dependency between them. Linking is only available for orders that match in type and side (Buy/Sell). Orders from other accounts, market orders, and SL/TP orders cannot be linked.

In order to cancel the order, tap the 'Cancel' button.
