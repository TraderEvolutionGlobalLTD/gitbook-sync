The **"**&#x4F;ther" settings section cannot be displayed in the application settings if the biometric authentication is not checked in the system settings of the device or it is blocked.&#x20;

Biometric authentication enables a user to log in to the mobile application more securely by using the Fingerprint or FaceID features.

To apply Fingerprint in the application for subsequent logins, a user should put his finger on the sensor.

After this, the checkbox More -> Settings -> Other -> Biometric authentication becomes True.

A user should enter his password to confirm biometrics:
