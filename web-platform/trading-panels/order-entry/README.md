This panel contains the following settings:

* Symbol – the symbol available for the trade;
* Side – allows to activate Buy or Sell side;
* Quantity / Cash – allows specifying the order's volume in either lots (Quantity) or currency (Cash), depending on the account’s permissions:
  * Quantity - the volume is set in lots. A ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1245).png>) button next to the field lets you select from preset default values in a dropdown list. The `Set defaults` option opens the Types Manager panel, where you can modify these default values;
  * Cash - when Cash is selected, the order amount is specified in account currency instead of lots. The estimated quantity (Est. Quantity) will be displayed below this field, showing the approximate number of lots, calculated using the following formula:\
    `Qty = CashOrderQty / ( Order price * Lot size * Сross price)`, where:\
    \- CashOrderQty - cash value entered in account currency;\
    \- Order price - order price depending on its type (_Market_ - current market price; _Limit_ and _Stop Limit -_ limit price; _Stop -_ stop price);\
    \- Lot size - symbol Lot size;\
    \- Cross price - conversion rate from the instrument currency to the account currency.\
    Please note that calculated Est. Quantity value is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the Lot Step (e.g., 0.01). For example if Qty = 0.07692, it will be rounded to 0.07.
* Leverage – contains leverage value, if applicable;
* Order type – defines the type of the order: Market, Limit, Stop, Stop limit, Trailing stop, Care, OCO:

1. Market order is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price immediately;
2. Limit order is placed to buy or sell a security at specified price or better;
3. Stop order is placed to buy or sell a security when its price surpasses a particular point, thus ensuring a greater probability of achieving a predetermined entry or exit price, limiting the investor's loss or locking in his or her profit. The<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/info web.png" alt="" data-size="original">icon informs a user that additional Limit price is available if the checkbox 'Use stop limit instead of stop' is active in General settings;&#x20;
4. Stop limit order will be executed at a specified price (or better) after given stop price has been reached. Once the stop price is reached, the Stop limit order becomes a Limit order to buy (or sell) at the limit price or better;
5. OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other) is an order stipulating that if one part of the order is executed, then the other part is automatically canceled;
6. Care order is a type of Limit order with expanded customization and flexibility. With Care orders, an Order entry panel includes an additional "Comment" field of up to 128 characters, allowing the user to provide specific information to the broker. Please note that Care orders may include an additional commission, which will be transparently displayed in fee breakdowns and margin calculations;
7. ‘Sell’ trailing stop order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price on the trailing offset. As the market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. ‘Buy’ trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell trailing stop orders;

* Validity – allows specifying order validity by selecting among the following time frames: Day, GTC, IOC, GTD, FOK, GTS. This is especially important for active traders:

1. A Day order, as the name implies, is valid for the current trading day;
2. GTC (Good till cancelled) orders, on the other hand, will remain alive until they are cancelled or the contract expires;
3. IOC (Immediate or cancel) requires the whole or part of the order to be executed immediately after it has been brought to the market;
4. FOK (Fill or kill) requires to execute the entire transaction immediately and completely or not to execute it at all;
5. GTD (Good till date) order will be cancelled on specified date if not executed or until the contract expires;
6. GTS (Good till session) order will be cancelled at the end of the trading session if not executed.

* Overnight execution - allows user to place orders that can be executed outside of regular market hours. If enabled, the order will be eligible for overnight execution. If disabled, the order will be executed only during standard trading hours. Please note that this option is shown only if overnight trading is available for your account and the selected instrument. Stop Loss and Take Profit orders will automatically inherit this setting;
* Stop price (for the ‘Stop order’ type) – allows entering the order stop price;
* Limit price (available together with Stop price for the ‘Stop order’ and ‘OCO’ order types; also available for the ‘Limit order’ type) – allows entering the order limit price;
* Tr. stop offset (for the ‘Trailing stop’ type) – allows entering the order trailing stop price.
* Comment - a field where you can provide additional details or instructions for the order. Maximum length is 128 characters. Available only for Care order type.

You can set up set the Stop loss and Take profit directly from the Order entry panel if needed.&#x20;
