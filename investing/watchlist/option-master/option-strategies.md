#### Single option&#x20;

A single-leg option is a basic strategy to buy or sell a Call/Put option. Depending on the side of a trade, there are four types of single-leg options:&#x20;

* Long call - gives the right to buy the underlying stock at strike price;
* Long put - gives the right to sell the underlying stock at strike price;
* Short call - obligates to sell stock at strike price if the option is assigned;
* Short put - obligates to buy stock at strike price if the option is assigned.

Long calls and short puts are bullish strategies, whereas long puts and short calls are bearish strategies.

#### Covered stock&#x20;

The covered stock strategy combines a stock position with a corresponding option contract. An owner of the underlying stock sells call options on that stock. The ownership of the stock “covers” the obligation of the call options.

Strategy is often used by neutral to slightly bullish stock owners.

#### Vertical spread&#x20;
